# @tjalve/qube-cli

Reusable TypeScript CLI infrastructure for command-line packages.

This package is a library foundation for CLI metadata, runtime wiring, help, schema, structured output, safety helpers, and tests. It is not a product-specific CLI, and it does not own the behavior or side effects of consuming commands.

## Installation

Use exact versions and keep lifecycle scripts disabled during dependency installation where supported:

```sh
pnpm add @tjalve/qube-cli@0.1.1 --save-exact --ignore-scripts
```

## Development baseline

- Node.js 24 or newer
- pnpm 11 or newer
- ESM-first TypeScript source
- Compiled JavaScript and declaration files in `dist/`

## Package boundary

Consuming packages own their command behavior, validation rules, product logic, state management, service integrations, policy decisions, and side effects. This package provides reusable infrastructure only; it does not mutate user projects, configure shells, install hooks, contact external services, or run background processes during normal installation.

## Adoption

- [Adoption guide](docs/adoption-guide.md): add command metadata, registry-backed runtime wiring, schema output, JSON trigger metadata, human/JSON output, and CLI contract tests.
- [Compatibility checklist](docs/compatibility-checklist.md): migrate existing commands command-by-command while preserving help, JSON, schema, exit-code, dry-run, and ownership boundaries.

## Verification

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-scripts
pnpm run build
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm run package-dry-run
```

## Release Provenance

Publish releases from immutable `publish-*` tags, not from `main`.

Release checklist:

1. Verify `main` is current and the release commit has passed CI.
2. Create an immutable release tag at the exact commit being published:

   ```sh
   git tag publish-<version>-<short-sha> <commit-sha>
   git push origin publish-<version>-<short-sha>
   ```

3. Confirm the tag resolves to the published commit:

   ```sh
   git fetch origin --tags
   git rev-parse publish-<version>-<short-sha>^{commit}
   ```

4. After npm publish completes, inspect the package attestation. The provenance external parameters must identify the tag ref, for example `refs/tags/publish-<version>-<short-sha>`, and the resolved source digest must match the tagged commit.
